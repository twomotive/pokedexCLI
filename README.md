## ðŸ“– About

Pokedex CLI is a command-line application that allows you to explore the world of PokÃ©mon right from your terminal. Built with Go, this application interacts with the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to fetch information about different PokÃ©mon, their locations, and more.

**This project was developed as a learning exercise to practice and demonstrate proficiency in Go development.**

## ðŸ’¡ Learning Objectives & Skills Demonstrated

Through building this project, I focused on learning and applying the following concepts in Go:

*   **Command-Line Interface (CLI) Development:** Creating an interactive REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) using standard Go libraries (`bufio`, `os`, `strings`).
*   **API Integration:** Consuming a third-party REST API (PokeAPI) using Go's `net/http` package.
*   **Data Handling:** Marshalling and unmarshalling JSON data.
*   **Concurrency:** (If applicable, add details here if concurrency was used, e.g., for API calls).
*   **Caching:** Implementing a simple in-memory cache (`pokecache`) to reduce API calls and improve performance.
*   **Project Structure:** Organizing code into logical packages (`internal/api`, `internal/cli`, `internal/config`, etc.).
*   **Dependency Management:** Using Go modules (`go.mod`).
*   **Error Handling:** Implementing robust error checking and reporting.
